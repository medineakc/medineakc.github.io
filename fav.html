          <h1>My essay about my small Queens neighborhood: Sunnyside.</h1>
          <p class="text1">Everyone in New York City has a rose.</p>
           <p class="text2"> A rose with its abundance of crimson red petals, each fragment blending together to create one beautiful composite flower. A rose that encapsulates all the owner has felt, experienced, and worked for with every reason, memory, and motive being stored within each petal.
            Everyone creates their rose bit by bit, petal by petal, memory by memory, in an array of different places. My rose, for instance, is centered in Sunnyside.
            Whenever I utter the word “Sunnyside”, I’m often met with confusion. I don’t think anyone outside of Queens has ever heard of the neighborhood. Even I don’t know of its boundaries, because I’ve always stuck around the same five blocks along Skillman Avenue—from 44th street to 48th street.</p>
          <p class="text3">My house stands on 48th street, among a line of similar but distinct set of houses. It seems like they all have the same floor plan, but each one has its own quirk: the first one on the road has a v-shaped roof, the second is painted navy blue, the fourth one looks like a jungle, and the last one is just plain basic. Then there’s my house, smack in the middle of the road, with its flat roof shining like a bald head. Of course, I live in the ugly one, and of course, we have the weird mulberry tree that hangs over the sidewalk. The tree is only tolerable during the spring, when gorgeous white flowers cover its thin limbs and shower us with petals like a greeting whenever we walk by. It makes for a cute Instagram story and I always find more people strolling by when the tree is in bloom. But nothing good ever lasts and that’s about the only good thing the tree provides. The flowers stay for a week and then turn into shriveled-up, brown remains. Last spring, I didn’t even see any flowers at all! The browned petals lying on the road signal for summer, when the tree bears fruit. My mom loves it. I don’t. I would, but only if it didn’t mean the neighbor would bother us every other day. Whenever she catches me in my backyard she pokes her head over the fence and asks, “Do you speak English?”, as if we hadn’t spoken a few days prior. Then she complains about how the “black things” fall from the tree and ruin her laundry, saying we should prune it. I never tell my mom about these interactions; the tree brings her so much joy. Every summer, she spends hours picking each mulberry to prepare it for me and my siblings. But my neighbor only cares about her drying lines. (which she can easily move; she has the biggest yard!) So I guess, the mulberry tree is one of the petals on my rose, even if I hate it.
            On 48th street lies the beloved Skillman Park. Its real name is Lou Lodati Park, but no one calls it that. The park is nothing extraordinary, in fact, it used to be a bit “ghetto”. The swingset was missing parts and would screech every time someone sat on it. The fences have a horrible paint job, with bits of tarred, onyx black paint peeling away to reveal the true rough, rusty metal surface beneath. There’s a large gap on the entrance gate because a kid got her head stuck in the tight space between the fence gaps, and the ambulance had to cut a rod off to free her. The volleyball courts have tattered nets that are stored next to the trash cans and behind them is where the local drunkards hang out, leaving their infamous scent of Corona in the backend of the park. The park, on the surface, seems like a terrible place. But each part of the playground forms a petal on my rose. I would climb the metal bars on the swingsets like a gymnast and show off to whoever was watching me. I would hop over the fences like a video game character back when my knees didn’t crack every time I squat. I would practice for my middle school volleyball competition in the open space because all the courts were always taken; it was always a race on who would get there first.</p>
          <p class="text4">But as I grew older, I started noticing all the thorns that had come along with each petal I’d crafted. When I first talked to people at my fancy little high school in Manhattan, my petals weren’t as beautiful as they used to be. My rose felt so different from everyone else’s that I completely discarded it. I handcrafted a new rose, a plastic one. Sunnyside is nothing like the NYC that other kids know. I never took the subway. I never had the thrill of jumping the turnstile. I never visited niche cafes that were a 20 minute commute away. I wasn’t living the idealized NYC life. Heck, I felt like I fit in better with the Long Islanders, even if I was closer to Manhattan than them. But no one knew that and I pretended I didn’t either. My new rose consists of every memory outside of Sunnyside, every memory that creates the “perfect” New York that everyone wants: boba shops, the SoHo shopping experience, the breakfast cafes in the Upper East Side, even wild encounters on the subway. My new rose only had one flaw: it wasn’t a reflection of my real New York.</p>
            <p class="text5">I wonder if anyone has ever noticed that my rose might be a little too vibrant, might have too few petals, or might have no thorns.</p>
            <p class="text6">I wonder if any other New Yorker also has two separate roses.</p>
